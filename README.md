# chat-app
This is a little application I made to learn a bit about Meteor.js.

Users who have signed up have the ability to join existing chat rooms or create their own.
A user can make their chat room private in which case any users wanting to join must first enter a password.

The application also keeps track of what users are in what rooms.
